                    <div class="consent">
                        <h2>Consent & Transparency</h2>
                        <p>Consent and Transparency are a big risk when investigating how companies are gathering consumer data, as recent studies show that there is a growing interest in our “digital societies” in how individuals can better control their personal data. A Eurobarometer survey from March 2019 revealed that half of the respondents (51%) felt only in partial control over the information they provided online, while 30% believed that they had no control at all. Only 14% of the respondents thought they were in complete control. A US survey from 2019 even showed 80% of respondents feeling they were not in control of their personal data.

                        <h2>Data Breaches</h2>
                        <p>The development of ethical standards in data science is shaped by increasing public awareness and concerns about data privacy and security. As data breaches are another major risk associated with data collection. The frequency and scale of data breaches have increased, exposing sensitive information and leading to significant financial and personal harm. For instance, the 2018 breach of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica affected up to 87 million users. Such breaches not only compromise personal information but also erode public trust in digital platforms and services. </p>

                    <div class="surveillance">
                        <h2>Sureveillance</h2>
                        <p>A risk of collecting consumer Data is Consumer Surveillance, this causes users to have the feeling of having their personal data is being invaded. This can happen though online surveillance such as tracking Ip addresses, cookies, browser fingerprinting, and location tracking. For example, the majority of Americans believe that all or most of what they do online and on their cellphone is being tracked by companies (72%) (Consumer Federation of America, 2022). This statistic shows the pervasive nature of consumer surveillance underscores the urgent need for robust data protection measures and transparent privacy policies to safeguard users' personal information.

                        <p>Data misuse refers to the unauthorized or illegal use of personal or sensitive information that has been collected, stored, or processed by an organization or individual.  (Seneviratne, n.d.). One example is the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Election Influencing, In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm, improperly harvested data from 87 million Facebook users for political profiling purposes. This data was allegedly used to influence elections, including the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum. The scandal sparked intense scrutiny of Facebook's data privacy practices, leading to CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifying before Congress. It also raised concerns about the ethical use of personal data in the age of digital campaigning and highlighted the potential for manipulation in democratic processes.
