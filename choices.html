                        <h2>Ethical and Legal Choices</h2>
                        <p>The choices that we have in regards to what the gathering of consumer data start with ethical and legal choices, such as privacy and consent, which includes ensuring that data collection practices include clear and transparent consent processes, informing users about what data is collected and how it will be used. As the “GDPR suggests that consent be given to collect data for an explicit and stated purpose” (Ethics in Data Collection | Ethical Considerations for Data Collection - TPXimpact, n.d.). Companies must also Implement techniques to anonymize data to protect individual identities and comply with privacy regulations. An example of an ethical responsibility that a company when handling data is protecting personally identifiable information (PII) such as full name, birthdate etc. This information should be stored in a secure database (5 Principles of Data Ethics for Business, 2021). This is not only a professional responsibility but also a societal necessity. Furthermore, given the global scope of data science, it is essential to harmonize ethical standards across different regions and cultures.</p>

                        <p>
                            When dealing with consumer data companies must prioritize securuity as 48% of US consumers have reported being victims of a data breach (Moore, 2023). This is largely concerning as a lot of consumer data is personally identifiable information. Companies must use encryption techniques to protect data at rest and in transit. Companies must also implement robust access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data such as conducting regular security audits, reviewing compliance with data protection laws and only collecting vital data (Customer Data Protection: 8 Steps to Securing Customer Data, n.d.).

                        <h2>Individual Choices</h2>
                        <p>In the digital age, managing personal data has become an essential skill for protecting individual privacy and security. One crucial aspect is awareness, which involves understanding what personal data is being collected by various apps and services (Acquisti et al., 2015). By staying informed, users can make more educated decisions about the apps they use and the permissions they grant. Additionally, adjusting privacy settings on devices and platforms allows individuals to control the amount of data shared, thereby reducing their digital footprint (Barth & de Jong, 2017). Another important step is utilizing opt-out options provided by services to limit data collection. These features empower users to restrict unnecessary data harvesting and maintain greater control over their personal information (Taylor, 2013). Beyond individual actions, advocacy and participation play a vital role in promoting privacy. By supporting policies and practices that emphasize data privacy and ethical use, individuals can contribute to broader societal changes that safeguard privacy rights (Solove, 2020). Through these combined efforts, individuals can better manage their personal data in an increasingly connected world.</p>
