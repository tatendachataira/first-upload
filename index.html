                        <h2>Defining the Topic (Data Collection Practices):</h2>
                        <p>Privacy, the topic of privacy is widely discussed within society, especially with various types of information about individuals, spending habits, behaviours and preferences are being recorded. Computer scientists and lawyers have been concerned about this since the 1960’s.  Consumer Data is of the most concern as consumer data is extremely valuable to business as advertisers can obtain information such as, finances, interest and beliefs amongst multiple demographics. (Baeker,2019). We must explore how companies gather consumer data, including methods such as cookies, tracking pixels, and data brokers. In today’s age companies gather consumer data in inexplicit ways without consent of individuals involved and individuals don’t know what their data is being used for.</p>

                        <h2>Justifying the Topic (Data Collection Practices)</h2>
                        <p>Context. In 2021 a survey was conducted which showed that 71 percent of companies in the EU collect personal data about consumers, In Canada this was 59 %, in the United States this was 73% (Statista, 2023). Companies have benefited from consumer data, such as personal, engagement and behavioural data.  as it allows them to tailor ads to certain demographics, improve customer experiences and to secure sensitive data (Freedman, 2023).  Although consumer data is being sold and purchased by companies, “this is estimated to be a $200 billion business, and all signs point to continued growth of the data-brokerage business” (Tucker, 2021).  Unfortunately, many consumers are unaware of this. Companies should be transparent and consent by implementing data privacy policies, providing clear information to consumers about data collection practices, and obtaining explicit consent for the use of personal information.</p>
